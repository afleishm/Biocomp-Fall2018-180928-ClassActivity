Work with a partner to complete the tasks below and submit your results via a pull request.


1. Pick a partner and decide who is the repo owner and who is the repo collaborator.
2. Owner should fork the TA’s repo on GitHub. This creates a version of the TA’s repo in the owner’s
GitHub account.
3. Owner needs to invite the collaborator to work on the forked repo. This can be accomplished by
clicking your small user icon in the upper right of your GitHub landing page and selecting “Your
profile”. Now click “Repositories” in the top middle of your profile, and click the name of the forked
repo. Now select “Settings” in the top middle of the repo page and “Collaborators” on the left. Enter
your collaborator’s GitHub username or email address in the box and click “Add collaborator”
4. Collaborator check your email and accept the invite to collaborate. This WILL NOT create a repo in
your GitHub account, but instead gives you access to the repo on the owner’s GitHub account. You are
now both allowed to pull and push content to this repo.
5. Owner and Collaborator now need to clone the forked repo (not the TA’s repo!) to their computers
in order to create a local Git repo linked to the GitHub repo. Use the command git clone <repo
url copied from GitHub> to do this.
6. Collaborator should use nano to create a text file that includes their three favorite movies as the
first three lines of the text file. Save this with an informative file name and commit a version of your
Git repo. In order to update the GitHub repo the collaborator must now push their latest commit to
GitHub. Use the command git push origin master to accomplish this. Git may ask you for your
GitHub username and password at this point.
7. Owner should make sure their local repository is in sync with the GitHub repo by pulling it’s contents
to their local Git repo. Use git pull origin master to accomplish this. Now, add your favorite three
movies to the fourth through sixth lines of the text file created by your collaborator. Commit your
changes to your local Git repo and push those changes to GitHub.
8. Collaborator synchronize your Git and GitHub repos by pulling the current version down from
GitHub.
9. Owner and Collaborator should now INDIVIDUALLY rank these movie titles to reflect their
preferences. Put your favorite movie on the first line and second favorite on the second line, etc. DO
NOT TALK TO EACH OTHER DURING THIS PROCESS!!!
10. Owner commit your changes to your local git repo and then push your changes to GitHub.
